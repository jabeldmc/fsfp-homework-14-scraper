Full Stack Flex Program Homework 14: Scraper


# Introduction

[Nendoroid](https://www.goodsmile.info/en/aboutnendoroids) is a Japanese series of palm-sized figures modeled after popular animation series. movies, comics, games, and other franchises. Nendoroids are poseable and you can mix and match parts of different characters. They are like a cute version of Mr. Potato Head!

This application scrapes information on Nendoroid releases in the [official site](https://www.goodsmile.info/en/aboutnendoroids) and allows the user to save entries into a personal wishlist. Additionally, the user can add notes to Nendoroids in their wish list and flag them as _bought_. Pretty handy for collectors!

Since there are more than a thousand Nendoroid releases, the application first scrapes a page listing Nendoroids by year (for example, [2019 releases](https://www.goodsmile.info/en/products/category/nendoroid_series/released/2019)) and then scrapes the detail page of randomly selected releases in that year (for example, [release #1000](https://www.goodsmile.info/en/product/7868/Nendoroid+Snow+Miku+Snow+Princess+Ver.html)).

The application asks the user for the year to look into and how many Nendoroids get details from.
